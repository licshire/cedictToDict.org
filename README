What is this
============
The main goal of this project is to provide a way to define Mandarin words (search via character, pinyin or English) using the default Ubuntu (Gnome) dictionary program.  It is attempting to do this by creating a [dict.org][dictorg] compatible dictionary. 

This code takes a dictionary in the [CC-CEDICT][cedict] format, and makes it into a format that the dict.org server can understand.  The dict.org format can then be used with the dictd server to create on-line search-able dictionaries.

The bulk of this code is written in Ruby.


Prerequisites
=============

To run this code you will need the following applications (aside from the usual make, ruby, etc):

   dictfmt
   dictdconfig (if you want to run a local testing server)
   dictd (if you want to run a local testing server)
   wget


Basic Usage
===========

First, you need to download the latest [CC-CEDICT][cedict] dictionary:

	$ make download

This will download and unzip the latest CC-CEDICT dictionary into the input folder.

You can then build the dictionaries.  All dictionaries are created the way with the make file, you simply pass in *DICT_TYPE* to create the different versions.  For example, to create the *pinyin* version you would do the following:

	$ make DICT_TYPE=pinyin

Once the dictionary is made, you can either install it locally, or zip it up for distribution.  The latter is simply:

	$ make DICT_TYPE=pinyin dist

Which will make a zip file in the output directory.  If you would like to install it locally you can do:

	$ make DICT_TYPE=pinyin install

If this is the first time you are installing the dictionary, you will need to do create a new configuration file (*dictdconfig -w*) and restart the dict server (*/ect/init.d/dictd restart*).

Valid settings for *DICT_TYPE* are *simplified*, *pinyin*, and *english*.
